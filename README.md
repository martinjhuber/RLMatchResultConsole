## Q&A

### Why did you build this as a Console App? Are you crazy?

Those are actually two questions. 

To answer the first: Graphical console apps are a thing of the past that I'm very fond of. I simply love the simplicity and look & feel. Believe me, it was sooo much fun to implement. Like in the "good old times". Additionally, I wasn't in the mood to write yet another overcomplicated responsive web application.

And to answer the second question: Maybe?
